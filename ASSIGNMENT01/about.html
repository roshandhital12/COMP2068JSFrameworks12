        <h3 id="origins">Origins of the term</h3>
        <p>
          The term is derived from the name of the town of Spa, Belgium, whose
          name is known back from Roman times, when the location was called
          Aquae Spadanae, sometimes incorrectly connected to the Latin word
          spargere meaning to scatter, sprinkle or moisten. The word spa itself
          denotes "fountain". Some experts also suggest that the word "spa"
          originated from the name of the Belgian town named Spa where a
          curative natural spring was discovered in the 14th century.
        </p>

        <h3 id="treatments">Treatments</h3>
        <p>
          A 'body treatment', 'spa treatment', or 'cosmetic treatment' is
          non-medical procedure to help the health of the body. It is often
          performed at a resort, destination spa, day spa, beauty salon or
          school.
        </p>

        <h3 id="trends">Recent trends</h3>
        <p>
          In the modern world spa therapies are linked to various domains
          including beauty, pampering, indulgence, and health. Spa industry is
          thought to be growing at a significantly high rate, and most
          importantly it is observed to embrace wellness as its core business.
          By the late 1930s more than 2,000 hot- or cold-springs health resorts
          were operating in the United States.
        </p>
